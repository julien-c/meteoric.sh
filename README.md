# Meteoric

Deploy Meteor on EC2 (or your own server)

## How to install and update

The easiest way to install (or update) `meteoric` is using curl:

```bash
$ curl https://raw.github.com/dnprock/meteoric.sh/master/install | sh
```

You may need to `sudo` in order for the script to symlink `meteoric` to your `/usr/local/bin`.

## How to use

Create a conf file named `meteoric.config.sh` in your project's folder, setting the following environment variables:

```bash
# IP or URL of the server you want to deploy to
APP_HOST=meteor.julien-c.fr

# If you want a different ROOT_URL, when using a load balancer for instance, set it here
#ROOT_URL=mycustom.url.com

# Comment this if your host is not an EC2 instance
EC2_PEM_FILE=~/.ssh/proxynet.pem

# What's your project's Git repo?
GIT_URL=git://github.com/SachaG/Microscope.git

# Does your project use meteorite, or plain meteor?
METEORITE=true

# If not using Meteorite, you need to specify this
METEOR_RELEASE=0.6.4

#If you have an external service, such as Google SMTP, set this
#MAIL_URL=smtp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@smtp.googlemail.com:465

# What's your app name?
APP_NAME=microscope

# If your app is not on the repository root, set this
APP_PATH=.

# If you would like to use a different branch, set it here
GIT_BRANCH=master

# Kill the forever and node processes, and deletes the bundle directory and tar file prior to deploying
FORCE_CLEAN=false

# If you want to do something before forever starts Meteor, you can do it here
# NOTE: Don't forget to use a semi-colon at the end of every command
#PRE_METEOR_START="export ENVIRONMENT=prod;"
```

Then just run:

```bash
$ meteoric setup

$ meteoric deploy
```

If you'd like to use a different location for meteoric.config.sh, supply it as a second parameter:

```bash
$ meteoric setup /path/to/your.config.sh

$ meteoric deploy /path/to/your.config.sh
```


## Tested on

- Ubuntu 13.04
- Ubuntu 12.10

## Inspiration

Hat tip to @netmute for his [meteor.sh script](https://github.com/netmute/meteor.sh). In our case though, we think having to rebuild native packages like `fibers` kind of defeats the whole point of bundling the Meteor app. Additionally, our approach enables hot code fixes (you don't have to stop/start your node server, and your users' apps shouldn't be disrupted).

This script is also based on this previous post: [How to deploy Meteor on Amazon EC2](http://julien-c.fr/2012/10/meteor-amazon-ec2/).

Cheers!
